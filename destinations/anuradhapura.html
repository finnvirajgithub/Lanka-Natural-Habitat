        <h1>Anuradhapura</h1>
        <p><strong>Anuradhapura</strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the most historically significant cities in Sri Lanka. As the first ancient capital of the island, it dates back over 2,500 years and was the heart of Sri Lankan civilization for more than a millennium. This sacred city is renowned for its well-preserved ruins of ancient Sinhalese culture, Buddhist monuments, and royal palaces.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Anuradhapura was founded in the 4th century BCE by King Pandukabhaya and became the capital of Sri Lanka during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa in the 3rd century BCE. The city flourished under numerous kings, with Buddhist culture deeply influencing its development. It became one of the world’s great centers of Theravada Buddhism after Emperor Ashoka of India sent his son, Mahinda Thero, to introduce Buddhism to Sri Lanka. Over time, Anuradhapura housed magnificent stupas, monasteries, and reservoirs, and its religious and political significance grew.</p>
        <p>The city was attacked by South Indian Chola invaders in the 10th century CE, leading to its decline and abandonment. However, it remained a key pilgrimage site, thanks to its many religious landmarks.</p>

        <h2>Key Attractions</h2>
        <ul class="attractions-list">
            <li><strong>Sri Maha Bodhi (Sacred Bo Tree):</strong> The oldest living tree in the world with a recorded history of over 2,300 years, grown from a branch of the original Bodhi tree in India under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.</li>
            <li><strong>Ruwanwelisaya:</strong> A magnificent stupa built by King Dutugemunu in 140 BCE. Its enormous white dome stands as a symbol of Buddhist devotion and architectural excellence.</li>
            <li><strong>Thuparamaya:</strong> The oldest stupa in Sri Lanka, constructed by King Devanampiya Tissa, enshrining the right collarbone of the Buddha.</li>
            <li><strong>Abhayagiri Monastery:</strong> A significant monastic complex and learning center of Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, with the impressive Abhayagiri Dagoba towering over 70 meters.</li>
            <li><strong>Jetavanaramaya:</strong> Once the tallest stupa in the ancient world, standing 122 meters high and made of millions of bricks, representing ancient engineering marvels.</li>
            <li><strong>Isurumuniya Temple:</strong> Famous for its stone carvings, including the renowned "Lovers of Isurumuniya," a blend of religious significance and artistic heritage.</li>
            <li><strong>Kuttam Pokuna (Twin Ponds):</strong> Beautifully crafted bathing tanks that are examples of advanced hydraulic engineering from the Anuradhapura period.</li>
            <li><strong>Mihintale:</strong> The mountain where Mahinda Thero first preached Buddhism to King Devanampiya Tissa. Mihintale is a major pilgrimage site with ancient ruins and spiritual significance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural and Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>Anuradhapura is not only a symbol of Sri Lanka's rich Buddhist heritage but also a testament to its ancient engineering prowess. The city's sophisticated irrigation systems, which include massive reservoirs like <strong>Tissa Wewa</strong> and <strong>Basawakkulama</strong>, supported agriculture for centuries and contributed to the kingdom's prosperity.</p>
        <p>Today, Anuradhapura remains a revered pilgrimage destination, where visitors and devotees can explore the remnants of a once-thriving spiritual and political capital. Its ancient monuments reflect the grandeur of Sri Lanka's past and continue to inspire awe among travelers from around the world.</p>
