        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Sigiriya</strong>, also known as the Lion Rock, is one of Sri Lanka’s most iconic landmarks. Rising nearly 200 meters above the surrounding plains, this ancient rock fortress and palace complex dates back to the 5th century CE. The site combines ancient urban planning, art, and architecture, making it a must-see destination for visitors interested in history, culture, and breathtaking views. Sigiriya is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains a symbol of Sri Lanka’s rich cultural heritage.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Sigiriya was built by King Kashyapa (477-495 CE), who chose this massive rock as the site for his royal residence and fortress after seizing the throne from his father. The rock was transformed into a complex citadel with elaborate gardens, reservoirs, and palaces. It is believed that the fortress was designed both as a royal palace and a stronghold against attacks.</p>
        <p>After King Kashyapa’s death, Sigiriya became a Buddhist monastery until it was eventually abandoned in the 14th century. The site was later rediscovered in the early 19th century by British explorers and has since become one of Sri Lanka’s most important archaeological sites.</p>

        <h2>Key Attractions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Lion’s Gate:</strong> The entrance to the summit of the rock is flanked by the remains of a massive lion statue. Visitors once climbed stairs through the lion’s mouth to reach the royal palace, giving Sigiriya its name, “Lion Rock.”</li>
            <li><strong>Frescoes:</strong> Sigiriya is famous for its ancient frescoes, which are believed to depict celestial maidens. These vibrant paintings, located on the rock’s western face, showcase the artistic achievements of the time.</li>
            <li><strong>Mirror Wall:</strong> Originally polished so well that the king could see his reflection, the Mirror Wall is inscribed with ancient graffiti from visitors dating back over a thousand years.</li>
            <li><strong>Royal Gardens:</strong> The gardens surrounding Sigiriya are some of the oldest landscaped gardens in the world. They include water gardens, terraced gardens, and boulder gardens, all designed with sophisticated irrigation systems.</li>
            <li><strong>The Summit:</strong> At the top of Sigiriya, the remains of King Kashyapa’s palace offer stunning panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. The summit includes the foundations of various royal structures, ponds, and gardens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Sigiriya is more than just a fortress; it is a masterpiece of ancient Sri Lankan urban planning, art, and architecture. The site’s advanced water management systems, combined with its stunning frescoes and palaces, have made it a symbol of ingenuity and creativity. Today, Sigiriya stands as a cultural icon, reflecting the grandeur of Sri Lanka’s ancient civilization.</p>
        <p>As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Sigiriya attracts thousands of visitors each year, all eager to experience its historical, artistic, and architectural wonders. Whether you’re climbing to the summit for breathtaking views or admiring the artistry of the frescoes, Sigiriya offers a captivating journey into Sri Lanka’s past.</p>
