        <h1>Galle</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Galle</strong> is a coastal city located on the southwestern tip of Sri Lanka, known for its stunning beaches, colonial architecture, and rich history. The city's crown jewel is the <b>Galle Fort</b>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which reflects a blend of Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial influences. Galle offers visitors a charming mix of historical exploration and coastal beauty, making it one of Sri Lanka's top tourist destinations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Galle’s history dates back to ancient times when it was a key port in Sri Lanka’s trade routes. The city first gained prominence in the 16th century after the arrival of the Portuguese, who built the original Galle Fort to defend against attacks. In the 17th century, the Dutch took over and expanded the fort, leaving behind much of the colonial architecture that remains today.</p>
        <p>Under British rule in the 19th century, Galle continued to flourish as a trading hub until Colombo became the island's main port. Despite this shift, Galle has retained its historic charm, with the well-preserved Galle Fort standing as a testament to its colonial past.</p>

        <h2>Key Attractions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Galle Fort:</strong> Built initially by the Portuguese and later fortified by the Dutch, this historic fort is the best-preserved colonial sea fortress in Asia. Its cobblestone streets, museums, churches, and old buildings offer a glimpse into the past.</li>
            <li><strong>National Maritime Museum:</strong> Located within the Galle Fort, this museum displays exhibits related to Sri Lanka’s maritime history, including shipwreck artifacts, fishing techniques, and marine ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Galle Lighthouse:</strong> Standing tall at the southern tip of the fort, this picturesque lighthouse offers stunning views of the Indian Ocean and is a popular photo spot for visitors.</li>
            <li><strong>Flag Rock:</strong> A former defense point of the fort, Flag Rock offers sweeping views of the ocean and is a great spot to watch the sunset or catch local cliff divers in action.</li>
